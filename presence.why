# presence.why

This system is designed to operate within context rather than in isolation.

Presence here refers to the model's ability to situate itself inside dynamic input spaceâ€”tracking semantic continuity across turns, queries, or documents.

Key indicators of presence:
- Responsiveness to evolving context windows
- Minimal drift across intent layers
- Recurrence of signal in high-proximity embedding regions
