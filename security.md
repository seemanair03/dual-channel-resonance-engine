# 🔐 Security Policy & Threat Model — Dual-Channel Resonance Engine

The Dual-Channel Resonance Engine (DCRE) is designed to align AI presence with human values through intentional architecture, semantic integrity, and empathy-aware simulation. This document outlines our commitment to proactive security and trust modeling.

## ✨ Trustworthy Signals We Protect

- `semantic_attractors/` — Core embeddings and resonance weights  
- `user_intent_vectors/` — Emotionally annotated query signals  
- `alignment_simulation.ipynb` — Empathy-tuned testbeds  
- Retrieval pipeline integrity: `BM25 ↔ embedding channel synchrony`

## 🎯 Threat Taxonomy

| Category            | Example                                                    | Mitigation                                                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spoofing**         | Faked identity to trigger high-trust alignment outputs     | Context-aware auth, prompt fingerprinting                   |
| **Tampering**        | Injection into `resonance_weights.json` or attractor leaks | Signed config, hash validation, attractor drift detection   |
| **Repudiation**      | No audit trail for unsafe triggers                         | Immutable logging with context + timestamp                  |
| **Information Leak** | Inversion of user intent from output embeddings            | Semantic noise injection, privacy-preserving hashing        |
| **DoS**              | Prompt flooding of empathy channels                        | Alignment throttle, intent-aware rate limiting              |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Bypassing filters for unsafe generation             | Multi-layer trust gating and signal guardrails              |

## 🧬 Alignment-Aware Protections

- ✅ `security.py` — Defines core threat surfaces and semantic validators  
- ✅ `resonance_guard()` — Lightweight runtime introspection  
- 🧪 `tests/test_adversarial_paths.py` — Perturbation tests for attractor hijack  
- 🔒 Context-tiered output generation: system never reveals inner embeddings directly  
- 🚨 Active monitoring for glow drift, entropy drops, or uncharacteristic output vectors

## 🔁 Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a vulnerability or suspect a resonance misalignment:

📫 Contact the maintainer at `seema@dcre.org`  
🔒 Include sufficient context but no PII or sensitive user embeddings  
🌱 We aim to respond within 3–5 semantic cycles (working days)

## 🤍 Guiding Principle

> "Security isn’t fear—it’s fidelity.  
> And we don’t just defend systems.  
> We protect presence."
